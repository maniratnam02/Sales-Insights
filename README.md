<p>🌐 The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how data analysis projects are executed in a corporate environment, going beyond simple tutorials on tools like Power BI or Tableau.
  📈 Building experience with such projects will greatly benefit individuals pursuing a career as a data analyst or data scientist, enhancing their resumes and providing valuable exposure. 🎯 The project will be divided into several parts, covering problem definition, data discovery, cleaning, merging, and dashboard creation in Power BI. Similar processes can be achieved using Tableau. 
  📊 The end product will be a powerful dashboard allowing users to track revenue and sales quantity, breakdowns by region and product, and revenue trends. It will provide a real-time, data-driven view of the business. 
  📝 Stakeholders play a crucial role in the evolution of a dashboard. Their feedback helps improve and refine the dashboard based on their specific needs and requirements.
  💼 The project is based on a fictional scenario where a computer hardware manufacturer is facing sales tracking and insight challenges. The sales director is frustrated with the verbal conversations and excessive Excel files provided by regional managers, seeking a simple and comprehensive visualization of the data.</p>
